My Code:

sentence = input("Please type in a sentence:")

index = 0

while index < len(sentence):
    if sentence[index] != " ":
        print(sentence[index])
    space = sentence[index:].find(" ")
    if space == -1:
        break
    index = index + space + 1


Courses code:

sentence = input("Please type in a sentence: ")
 
sentence = " " + sentence
 
index = 1
while index < len(sentence):
    if sentence[index-1] == " " and sentence[index] != " ":
        print(sentence[index])
    index += 1
